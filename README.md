# PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER 🔐🔒
# project overview 📌
Here its my task number 2 for cyber security internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

# ✨FEATURES
Assesses the security of a password by analyzing several factors, including length, character diversity, and common patterns.

# 🚀LANGUAGE USED:
Python language is used to build this project.


# 🛠️⚙️WORKING OF THE PROJECT:
1. Input and Analysis:
The user enters a password into the tool. 
The tool's algorithm analyzes the password's characteristics. 
This analysis often includes checking:
Length: Longer passwords are generally stronger. 
Character Types: Using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases complexity. 
Common Patterns: Checks for sequential characters (like "12345"), common keyboard patterns ("qwerty"), and dictionary words or phrases. 
Repetitions: Identifies repeated characters or patterns. 
Known Breached Passwords: Some tools compare the entered password against lists of passwords exposed in data breaches. 

2. Strength Assessment:
Based on the analysis, the tool assigns a strength score or rating (e.g., weak, medium, strong).
Some tools provide estimated crack times, indicating how long it might take an attacker to guess the password.
Feedback is often presented visually, using colors (e.g., green for strong, red for weak) or progress bars. 


3. Suggestions for Improvement:
The tool may offer specific advice on how to strengthen the password, such as:
Increasing the length.
Adding more character types.
Avoiding common patterns or dictionary words.
Using a unique password for each online account. 


4. Client-Side Processing:
Many password strength checkers are implemented using JavaScript, meaning the analysis happens directly in the user's browser, without sending the password to a server.
This ensures password privacy and security during the testing process.
